** Linked Lists 
   + A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in 
     memory. 
   + A group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
   + Each node is composed of data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. 
   + Linked lists are slow because they are linear. 
   + Arrays may prove to be a better choice if cache locality, faster access like random accessed is a factor. 
   
*** Pseudocode for Basic Operations
  #+BEGIN_SRC pseudocode
  Add(value)
    Pre: value is the value to add to the list
    Post: value has been placed at teh tail of the list
    n <- node(value)
    if head = 0 
      head <- n
      tail <- n
    else
      tail.next <- n 
      tail <- n
    end if 
  end Add

* Linked Lists 
  + A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in 
    memory. 
  + A group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
  + Each node is composed of data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. 
  + Linked lists are slow because they are linear. 
  + Arrays may prove to be a better choice if cache locality, faster access like random accessed is a factor.
